# CIBMTR-EfficientNetV2 
This repo contains my solution for CIBMTR competition. The comprtition was hosted on Kaggle and the task was to improve the prediction of transplant survival rates for patients undergoing allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT).

All training was done on GPU P100 on kaggle.

I adopted a new method, EfficientNetV2, to complete the competition. My solution received 3 votes and 4 copies in the kaggle community.

**Model Selection**

Inspired by the efficiency of EfficientNetV2 in image predication, I wanted to explore its potential for non-image predication. I chose Efficientnetv2_b2.
